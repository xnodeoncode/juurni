# juurni

A project for test driving indexedDB in the browser. [Juurni](https://bacardibryant.github.io/juurni/ "Juurni") is a browser based daily journaling app that allows users to select a calendar date and add ideas, memories, moments, notes, recollections, you name it, for the day.

Each journal entry is saved to the browsers indexeddb as a key/pair object. Being that this project was just an exploration of indexedDB, not all CRUD actions have been implemented.

In order to view the saved journal entries, you must use the browser's developer tools and navigate to storage > indexDB if it is supported.

I'm not sure if I'll finish this the project completely as there are already many, feature rich, journaling applications available.

Juurnii makes use of the calendar plugin offered by [YSCoder](https://github.com/yscoder/Calendar "YSCoder").
